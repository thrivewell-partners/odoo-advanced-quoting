# odoo-advanced-quoting

An Odoo 19 Community module for distribution quoting on top of the Sales app: bundles with
unpriced members, alternatives and add-ons kept out of the order total, distribution header fields,
and document styles set by the customer's tag. Configured by each client's admin in Settings. Radiant
Energy Distribution, moving off QuoteWerks, is the first client.

| Module | Status | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `twp_advanced_quoting` | M2 done: bundles printed as one priced row, per-bundle quantities, bundles on quotation templates, the adjustment product, margins by section. M1 before it: header fields, introduction, Hide Price, line numbers and code column, quote, order and invoice numbers in Settings. Alternatives (M3) next. Not yet released to any client | Everything in the build map's s3.1 to s3.6 |

This repo is the master copy. Releases are copied into each client's code repo, which is that
client's addons path on Oduflow.

The design lives in ThriveWell's tree at
`thrivewell/work/design/2026-10-12-advanced-quoting-build-map.md`, with what Odoo 19 already does in
`2026-10-12-advanced-quoting-odoo-base-map.md` beside it.
